-- cross join
-- returns the cartesian product of rows from tables in the join.
-- normal uses are for checking the server's performance.

SELECT *

-- inner join
-- requires each row in the two joined tables to satisfy join-predicate

-- natural join
-- The result of the natural join
--   is the set of all combinations of tuples in R and S
--   that are equal on their common attribute names.
-- in particular, the natural join allows the combination of relations
--   that are associated by a foreign key.
-- composition of relations.
-- relational counterpart of logical AND.
-- in category theory, the join is precisely the fiber product.

SELECT *
FROM employee NATURAL JOIN department;

-- outer join

-- the joined table retains each row
--   even if no other matching row exists.
-- left outer joins, right outer joins, and full outer joins
--   depending on which table's rows are retained: left, right, or both.

-- joining a table to itself.
